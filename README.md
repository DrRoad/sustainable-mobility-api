# Transport CO2

Library to calculate CO2 (equivalent) emissions for a given transport trip.

## Goals

The main design goals of this library are to provide:

- a statistical estimate of greenhouse gase emissions given information about a trip (origin/destination, mode, and/or distance)
- a simple interpretation of the statistical emissions estimate, in terms such as "high" or "low"
